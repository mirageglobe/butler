Background
===========================

This script is a general bash script that installs and setups the basic applications and packages for a ubuntu based system. This primarily acts as a self reminder for myself but feel free to add and improve this; by making it more efficient.

I had to suppress all the prompts as you can see; making most silent as this is meant to work nicely (ish) with Vagrant.

Thanks.
